Explanation of the Theme Selection System
User Input: The program prompts the user to select a theme (Light or Dark) by entering a number (1 or 2).

Factory Selection: Based on the user's input, the corresponding factory is instantiated:

If the user chooses 1, the LightThemeFactory is created.
If the user chooses 2, the DarkThemeFactory is created.
Component Creation: The selected factory creates the appropriate components:

A Button and a Checkbox specific to the chosen theme.
Display: The program then calls the display() method on each component to output their names (e.g., "Dark Button" and "Dark Checkbox") to the console.
